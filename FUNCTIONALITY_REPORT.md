### 2. **API Endpoints**
Complete REST API implementation with:

- **Authentication**
  - JWT token obtain: `POST /api/token/`

- **Version 1 APIs** (`/api/v1/`)
  - Accounts: User registration, profile management
  - Buses: CRUD operations, real-time status
  - Drivers: Registration, approval, ratings
  - Lines: Routes, stops, schedules
  - Tracking: GPS updates, passenger counts, trips
  - Notifications: Send notifications, manage devices

### 3. **Permissions & Security**
- Role-based access control
- Custom permission classes:
  - `IsAdmin`: Admin-only operations
  - `IsDriver`: Driver-specific features
  - `IsPassenger`: Passenger access
  - `IsOwnerOrReadOnly`: Owner-based permissions
  - `IsApprovedDriver`: Approved drivers only

### 4. **Background Tasks (Celery)**
- Celery configuration with Redis broker
- Task scheduling with django-celery-beat
- Notification dispatch tasks
- Periodic data cleanup
- Real-time data processing

### 5. **Multi-language Support**
- Arabic (ar)
- French (fr)
- English (en)
- django-modeltranslation integration

### 6. **Docker Setup**
- Multi-stage Dockerfile (development/production)

## üìä Implementation Status

### Fully Implemented ‚úÖ
- Database models and relationships
- RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication system (JWT)
- Permission framework
- Real-time tracking models
- Notification system structure
- Multi-language configuration
- Docker containerization
- API test suites

### Partially Implemented ‚ö†Ô∏è
- External service integrations:
  - Firebase (structure ready, credentials needed)
  - Twilio SMS (structure ready, credentials needed)
  - Google Maps (structure ready, API key needed)
- GIS functionality (disabled due to GDAL dependency)
- API documentation (drf-spectacular disabled)

### Configuration Required üîß
1. Environment variables for production
2. External service credentials
3. GDAL library for GIS features
4. SSL certificates for HTTPS
5. Domain configuration

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start (Docker)
```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Run migrations
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run tests
docker compose exec web python manage.py test
```

### Access Points
- API: http://localhost:8000/api/
- Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health/

### Default Ports
- PostgreSQL: 5433 (mapped from 5432)
- Redis: 6380 (mapped from 6379)
- Django: 8000
- Flower: 5555

## üìù Notes

### Missing Dependencies
Some optional dependencies were commented out to simplify testing:
- `django.contrib.gis` - Requires GDAL library
- `drf-spectacular` - For API documentation
- `debug_toolbar` - For development debugging

### Test Execution
Due to dependency issues, full test suite execution in Docker requires:
1. Installing GDAL system libraries
2. Adding missing Python packages
3. Using simplified test settings

### Production Readiness
The application is structurally complete and ready for:
- Adding external service credentials
- Installing additional dependencies
- Deploying to production environment
- Scaling with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes
