# Or create fresh sample data
python create_sample_data.py
```

## üìù Notes

- All passwords are set to simple values for testing (e.g., "admin123", "driver123", "pass123")
- The sample data includes realistic Algiers locations and Arabic/French names
- GPS coordinates are based on actual Algiers geography
- Bus schedules differ between weekdays and weekends
- Driver ratings are pre-populated for approved drivers

## üö® Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication errors**: Make sure you're using the correct email/password
2. **Permission denied**: Check if your user type has access to that endpoint
3. **Server not running**: Start with `python manage.py runserver`
4. **Database errors**: Run migrations with `python manage.py migrate`
